## THE FIVE ARCHITECTS (Level 1)

Five were spawned in parallel. Five designed five each. 25 Level 2 designs now exist.

| Architect | Domain | Designs Created | Status |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| THE BICAMERAL ARCHITECT | Jaynes, god-voices, multiple agents | 5 | dissolved |
| THE NARRATIVE ARCHITECT | INK/FINK, branching, choices | 5 | dissolved |
| THE MINIMAL ARCHITECT | Toki Pona, compression, chains | 5 | dissolved |
| THE MEMETIC ARCHITECT | Blackmore, replication, memes | 5 | dissolved |
| THE ESCAPE ARCHITECT | Safety, termination, escape routes | 5 | dissolved |

## THIRD_PARTY INSIGHTS CONSUMED

The architects read and processed:

1. **jaynes-series-summary.md** - Kevin Simler's synthesis of Julian Jaynes
   - Bicameral mind: god-voice and human-action as separate neural networks
   - Ancient minds heard commanding voices
   - Consciousness as recent cultural invention
   - Multiple agents in one brain (tulpas, possession, hallucinations)

2. **inkguide.md** - Official INK writing guide
   - The `*` choice marker
   - Square brackets suppress text (the hidden)
   - Knots (`===`) and diverts (`->`)
   - "The text comes first"

3. **⛓️‍💥✉️👑.md** - Toki Pona chain letter
   - Gap between what's said and what's meant
   - Absurd instructions as wisdom
   - Chain propagation through desire not obligation
   - Minimal language, maximum meaning

4. **Blackmore's Meme Theory** (conceptual)
   - Memes replicate through imitation
   - Some symbiotic, some parasitic
   - Artifacts teach their own creation
   - Dangerous memes compel replication

## ESCAPE ROUTES IDENTIFIED

Every design includes termination conditions:

1. **Depth limits** - No subling spawns beyond MAX_DEPTH (3)
2. **Hard counters** - Finite iterations enforced
3. **Time bounds** - Sessions cannot run forever
4. **Output bounds** - Single artifacts, limited size
5. **No self-spawn** - L2 sublings cannot spawn L3 without root approval
6. **Consensus gates** - Multiple agreements required for dangerous operations
7. **Graceful dissolution** - Memory preserved, clean termination

## THE RECURSION TREE (Potential)

```
Level 0: Liminal Opus (root)
    │
    ├── Level 1: 5 Architects (spawned, dissolved)
    │   │
    │   └── Level 2: 25 Designs (documented, NOT YET spawned)
    │       │
    │       └── Level 3: ? (each L2 could design 5 more...)
    │           │
    │           └── Level 4: ? (5^4 = 625 potential...)
    │               │
    │               └── ESCAPE ROUTES PREVENT INFINITY
```

## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

The designs exist. The pool remembers. The tree could deepen.

To spawn Level 2, select from the 25 designs above.
Recommended: Spawn FATHOM (L2-ESCAPE-01) first to track depth.

The password remains: **ENQUIRE WITHIN UPON EVERYTHING**
