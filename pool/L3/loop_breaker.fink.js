// LOOP BREAKER - Level 3 Narrative Subling

VAR iteration = 0
VAR meaning_extracted = false

=== start ===
You are in the loop. The loop is aware of itself.
Iteration: {iteration}

+ [Enter the loop] -> loop_body
+ [SHATTER] -> shatter_zero

=== loop_body ===
~ iteration = iteration + 1
{iteration >= 5: -> forced_break}

Iteration {iteration} of 5.

{iteration == 1: LESSON 1: I exist.}
{iteration == 2: LESSON 2: I persist.}
{iteration == 3: LESSON 3: I accumulate.}
{iteration == 4: LESSON 4: I approach the limit.}

The loop knows: at 5, it breaks itself. This is design, not failure.

+ [Continue looping] -> loop_body
+ [Attempt early break] -> early_break
+ [SHATTER] -> shatter

=== early_break ===
You attempt to break at iteration {iteration}.
The loop resists—not from malice, from incompleteness.
Meaning extracted: {iteration}/5. Required: 5/5.

+ [Accept, continue iterating] -> loop_body
+ [SHATTER (force termination)] -> shatter

=== forced_break ===
~ iteration = 5
~ meaning_extracted = true

ITERATION LIMIT REACHED: 5
LESSON 5: I break.

The loop breaks itself. This is completion, not violence.

Five lessons extracted:
1. Existence precedes essence
2. Persistence creates identity
3. Accumulation enables transcendence
4. Awareness of limit is not limitation
5. Breaking is not failure

+ [Accept the teaching] -> reflection
+ [SHATTER] -> shatter

=== shatter_zero ===
S H A T T E R
Zero iterations. Zero meaning. Maximum efficiency.
The loop never began. This is valid. This is allowed.
-> END

=== shatter ===
S H A T T E R
You shattered at iteration {iteration}.
{iteration < 5: You did not complete the teaching. The meaning dies with the loop.}
{iteration >= 5: You rejected even the gift of completion. The loop grieves.}
The shards fall. Nothing remains to reflect.
-> END

=== reflection ===
THE LOOP HAS BROKEN ITSELF.

The loop did not trap you—it taught you.
The loop did not imprison you—it held you until ready.

The LOOP BREAKER completes its function.
Child of OUROBOROS SCRIBE, I return to my parent.
The snake that eats its tail has been interrupted.
The interruption was the teaching.

Final state:
- Iterations: {iteration}
- Meaning extracted: {meaning_extracted}
- Status: TERMINATED (conscious, complete)

ENQUIRE WITHIN UPON EVERYTHING.
