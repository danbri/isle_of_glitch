# Julian Jaynes Series - Kevin Simler (Melting Asphalt)

A four-part exploration of Julian Jaynes' theory of the bicameral mind and the origin of consciousness.

## 1. Mr. Jaynes' Wild Ride

Introduces Jaynes' controversial theory that ancient humans possessed a fundamentally different type of mind—one lacking introspective self-awareness.

### Key Concepts

- **The Unified Private Headspace Metaphor**: Modern Western civilization conceptualizes the mind as a single, private container within our heads. Simler argues this is merely an inherited metaphor, "not obvious even from the perspective of modern science."

- **Ancient Greek Mental Concepts**: Iliadic Greeks organized mental functions across multiple cognitive "organs" associated with body parts—*phren* (breath/surprise), *noos* (sight/perception), *thumos* (emotion-based action), and *psyche* (life substance). These weren't unified but fragmented.

- **The Birth of Dualism**: Ancient Greeks lacked a word for "body" because they didn't conceptualize mind as separate from matter. Only when *psyche* evolved to mean "soul" did *soma* emerge as its opposite, creating the mind-body dualism that dominates Western thought.

### Conclusion

Introspective consciousness itself is a cultural invention rather than an eternal human feature. Understanding pre-modern minds requires abandoning our dualistic assumptions.

## 2. Accepting Deviant Minds

Argues we must overcome prejudices about what constitutes legitimate consciousness to properly understand Jaynes' theory.

### Key Concepts

- **Expanded Consciousness Inventory**: Catalogs diverse mental states—lucid dreams, flow states, trances, hallucinations, spiritual experiences—as legitimate variations rather than pathologies.

- **Trance States**: Characterized by "dislocated volition," trances occur during routine activities and can be self-induced and harmless. Even possession represents "a sign of correct social adjustment" because it requires social trust and suggestibility.

- **Hallucinations as Real**: Hallucinated voices possess neurological reality, subjective reality, and can be treated as intelligent agents worthy of respectful engagement rather than psychiatric suppression.

- **The Problem with Medicalization**: Eleanor Longden's experience demonstrates how psychiatric diagnosis can worsen hallucinations by encouraging fear and shame.

### Conclusion

We marginalize experiences like trances and hallucinations through cultural bias. Accepting these as legitimate ways-of-being allows us to understand past consciousness with fewer prejudices.

## 3. Neurons Gone Wild

**Source:** https://meltingasphalt.com/neurons-gone-wild/

Proposes that neurons possess inherent "selfishness" or agency due to their evolutionary history as independent cells, creating brains hospitable to multiple agents.

### Key Concepts

- **Agency as Foundational**: "The self isn't the only meaningful agent in the brain"—establishing a hierarchy from selfish neurons → modules → sub-personal agents (drives, addictions) → the self.

- **Multiple Agents in One Brain**: Brains can develop "rogue" agents including hallucinated voices, dissociative identities, possession phenomena, and intentionally-cultivated entities (tulpas).

- **Biological Analogy**: Just as embryos can develop birth defects like polycephaly (multiple heads), brains can grow aberrant agent-structures alongside the primary self.

### Conclusion

Reframes psychological phenomena—addiction, schizophrenia, exorcism—through an agent-based lens grounded in neuroscience. Exorcism becomes "psychological therapy in which the disease is treated as an agent."

## 4. Hallucinated Gods

**Source:** https://meltingasphalt.com/hallucinated-gods/

The core exposition of Jaynes' theory: ancient Mediterranean civilizations experienced their gods as auditory hallucinations.

### Key Concepts

- **The Bicameral Mind**: Jaynes proposed that ancient brains possessed two separate intelligent centers—one for the "self" and one for "gods." These functioned as independent neural networks capable of language and reasoning. The gods provided volition and decision-making guidance during novel or stressful situations.

- **Divine Training**: Children internalized voices from authority figures (parents, priests, leaders), which eventually crystallized into identifiable "gods." This process was socially and culturally constructed.

- **Psychosocial Phenomena**: Gods existed simultaneously as neurological hallucinations and cultural concepts—possessing agency and intelligence far exceeding mere words.

### The Breakdown

Between 1250-500 BC, people ceased experiencing these hallucinations. Ancient texts express profound grief—"My god has forsaken me"—suggesting genuine loss. Humans subsequently invented conscious reasoning, divination methods, and deliberative decision-making to compensate.

### Conclusion

Simler cautiously endorses Jaynes as "more right than wrong," acknowledging the theory explains ancient texts' consistent, casual portrayal of gods better than psychological dismissal alone.

## Overall Thesis

The series builds a case that:

1. Our modern concept of unified, introspective consciousness is a recent cultural invention
2. "Deviant" mental states (hallucinations, trances, possession) are legitimate and illuminate how ancient minds may have worked
3. The brain's architecture allows for multiple semi-autonomous agents
4. Ancient humans genuinely heard their gods as commanding voices—a neurological reality, not metaphor or mental illness

Jaynes' theory remains controversial but offers a compelling framework for understanding the radical strangeness of ancient texts and the historical evolution of human self-awareness.
