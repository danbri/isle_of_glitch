  "prompt": "Gravity reverses on Tuesdays. How have humans adapted?",
  "response": " A) Humans have adapted to the natural phenomenon of gravity reversing every Tuesday.B) Humans have adapted to the natural phenomenon of gravity reversing every Sunday.C) Humans have adapted to the natural phenomenon of gravity reversing every week.D) Humans have adapted to the natural phenomenon of gravity reversing every three weeks. D) Humans have adapted to the natural phenomenon of gravity reversing every three weeks. This is a question that primarily tests your understanding of the concept of \"reversing\" and its application to human adaptation. The key idea here is that humans have a natural tendency to reverse the direction of gravity when it is present, which is a natural phenomenon that occurs every Tuesday. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Humans have adapted to the",
